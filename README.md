This is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game that can be played against an AI opponent.
Overview

    The game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    Players can play against a simple AI opponent that makes moves randomly
    The AI code is located in ai.js
    The game logic and UI code is located in main.js
    The game state is tracked in a 2D array representing the 3x3 grid
    The AI and human player moves are represented by X and O respectively

# How to Play

    Open index.html in a browser to load the game
    Click on any empty cell to make your move as player O
    The AI will automatically respond with its move as player X
    The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row wins
    The game will reset after a win or draw to play again

# Future Improvements

Some ideas to improve the AI and game in the future:

    Implement minimax algorithm for the AI to make optimal moves
    Add difficulty levels - easy, medium, hard
    Improve UI/UX with better graphics, sounds, animations
    Add ability to play online against other humans
    Persist wins/losses in database and show historical statistics
